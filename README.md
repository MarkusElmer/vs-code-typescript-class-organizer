## Configuration

Extensions supports the following configuration options:

- `tsco.useRegions`: When true regions surrounding member groups are added. True by default.
- `tsco.addPublicModifierIfMissing`: When true public access modifier is added. True by default.
- `tsco.addRegionIndentation`: When true regions are indented with class members. True by default.
- `tsco.addRegionCaptionToRegionEnd`: When true region caption is added to region end as well. True by default.
- `tsco.groupPropertiesWithDecorators`: When true properties with decorators will come first. False by default.
- `tsco.addRowNumberInRegionName`: When true region children count added on title. True by default.
- `tsco.accessorsBeforeCtor`: When true put accessor before ctor during organization. False by default.
- `tsco.memberOrder`: Configuration of grouping and ordering of members.
- `tsco.treatArrowFunctionPropertiesAsMethods`: When true arrow function properties will be treated as methods.
- `tsco.organizeOnSave`: When true file will get organized automatically whenever saved. False by default.

### Configuration of grouping and ordering of members

By default members are grouped and ordered in the following way:

- properties,
  - private static const properties,
  - private const properties,
  - private static readonly properties,
  - private readonly properties,
  - private static properties,
  - private properties,
  - protected static const properties,
  - protected const properties,
  - protected static readonly properties,
  - protected readonly properties,
  - protected static properties,
  - protected properties,
  - public static const properties,
  - public const properties,
  - public static readonly properties,
  - public readonly properties,
  - public static properties,
  - public properties,
- constructors,
- public static indexes,
- public indexes,
- public abstract indexes,
- protected static indexes,
- protected indexes,
- protected abstract indexes,
- private static indexes,
- private indexes,
- private abstract indexes,
- public static accessors,
- public accessors,
- public abstract accessors,
- protected static accessors,
- protected accessors,
- protected abstract accessors,
- private static accessors,
- private accessors,
- private abstract accessors,
- public static methods,
- public methods,
- public abstract methods,
- protected static methods,
- protected methods,
- protected abstract methods,
- private static methods,
- private methods,
- private abstract methods.

This configuration can ge changed by using the `tsco.memberOrder` setting in settings.json. Members can be grouped separately or grouped together with other member groups in a two level hierarchy. Every group has a property:

- `caption` (only for top level groups): the caption will be outputted if `tsco.useRegions` is set to true,
- `memberReorder`: indicates how the members of the specific group should be reordered. Possible values: `none`;`alphabetically`. Default (or if not defined): `none`
- `memberType` (top and bottom level groups): the type of the member in the group (privateStaticConstProperties, privateConstProperties, privateStaticReadOnlyProperties, privateReadOnlyProperties, privateStaticProperties, privateProperties, protectedStaticConstProperties, protectedConstProperties, protectedStaticReadOnlyProperties, protectedReadOnlyProperties, protectedStaticProperties, protectedProperties, publicStaticConstProperties, publicConstProperties, publicStaticReadOnlyProperties, publicReadOnlyProperties, publicStaticProperties, publicProperties, constructors, publicStaticIndexes, publicIndexes,
  publicAbstractIndexes, protectedStaticIndexes, protectedIndexes, protectedAbstractIndexes, privateStaticIndexes, privateIndexes, privateAbstractIndexes, publicStaticMethods, publicMethods, publicAbstractMethods, protectedStaticMethods, protectedMethods, protectedAbstractMethods, privateStaticMethods, privateMethods, privateAbstractMethods),
- `subGroups` (only for top level groups): the array of member types to be included in this group.

Example of the default `tsco.memberOrder` setting:

```json
